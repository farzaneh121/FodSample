# FodSample
This project is a sample of java EE including java servlet, jsp and JDBC

Fod is a project about shopping and I developed this project for learning javaEE without using of maven and hibernate!
I tried to use MVC and Front Controller design patterns. I have added an exception handler and a Servlet Filter for security autentication controll.
